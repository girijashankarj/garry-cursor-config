# Security Guide

## Overview
cursor-config includes built-in security guardrails that protect against common vulnerabilities.

## Security Rules

### 1. Secret Management
All secrets must be loaded from environment variables or a secrets manager.

**Pattern:**
```typescript
// CORRECT
const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;

// WRONG — Never do this
const apiKey = "sk-1234567890abcdef";
```

### 2. PII Protection
Never log personally identifiable information.

**Safe to log:** userId, correlationId, operation, duration, status
**Never log:** email, name, phone, SSN, credit card, IP address

### 3. SQL Safety
Always use parameterized queries and soft deletes.

```sql
-- CORRECT
UPDATE orders SET active_indicator = false WHERE id = $1;

-- WRONG
DELETE FROM orders WHERE id = '${orderId}';
```

### 4. Input Validation
Validate all external input at the API boundary.

### 5. Authentication
- Use short-lived tokens (15 min for access, 7 days for refresh)
- Hash passwords with bcrypt/argon2
- Implement rate limiting on auth endpoints

## Security Checklist
Before every release:
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets (run `/check-secrets`)
- [ ] No PII in logs
- [ ] Dependencies audited (run `/audit-deps`)
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] Parameterized queries only
- [ ] Authentication on protected routes
- [ ] Rate limiting configured
- [ ] Security headers set
