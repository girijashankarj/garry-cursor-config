## Estimation Framework
| Complexity | Points | Time | Characteristics |
|-----------|--------|------|----------------|
| Trivial | 1 | <2h | Single file, known pattern |
| Simple | 2 | 2-4h | Few files, clear approach |
| Medium | 3 | 4-8h | Multiple files, some unknowns |
| Complex | 5 | 1-2d | Cross-cutting, new patterns |
| Very Complex | 8 | 2-5d | Architectural changes |
| Epic | 13+ | 1+ week | Break down further |

## Output Format
- **Estimate**: Points and time range
- **Breakdown**: Task-level estimates
- **Assumptions**: What we're assuming
- **Risks**: Factors that could increase effort
- **Confidence**: Low / Medium / High
