# Containerization Rules

## Dockerfile Best Practices

### Multi-Stage Build Template
```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Dependencies
FROM node:20-alpine AS deps
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json {{CONFIG.techStack.packageManager}}-lock.yaml ./
RUN {{CONFIG.techStack.packageManager}} install --frozen-lockfile

# Stage 2: Build
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
RUN {{CONFIG.techStack.packageManager}} run build

# Stage 3: Production
FROM node:20-alpine AS runner
WORKDIR /app
RUN addgroup --system --gid 1001 appgroup && \
    adduser --system --uid 1001 appuser
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder /app/package.json ./
USER appuser
EXPOSE 3000
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=10s CMD wget --spider http://localhost:3000/health || exit 1
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

## Rules
- **ALWAYS** use multi-stage builds for minimal image size
- **ALWAYS** run as non-root user in production
- **NEVER** use `latest` tag — pin specific versions
- **ALWAYS** include a health check endpoint
- Use `.dockerignore` to exclude: node_modules, .git, tests, docs, .env
- Minimize layers — combine RUN commands where logical
- Order Dockerfile commands from least to most frequently changed (for cache optimization)
- Scan images for vulnerabilities before pushing to registry

## Docker Compose (Development)
- Use for local development environment
- Define all service dependencies (database, cache, queue)
- Mount source code as volumes for hot reload
- Use environment files for configuration
- Include health checks for all services
