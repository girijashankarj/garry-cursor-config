# Documentation Standards

## Code Documentation
- Document **why**, not **what** — code should be self-documenting for the "what"
- Use JSDoc/TSDoc for all public functions and classes
- Document complex algorithms with inline comments
- Keep README.md up to date with every significant change

### JSDoc Template
```{{CONFIG.techStack.language}}
/**
 * Calculates the total price for an order including taxes and discounts.
 *
 * @param items - Array of order items with price and quantity
 * @param taxRate - Tax rate as a decimal (e.g., 0.08 for 8%)
 * @param discountCode - Optional promotional discount code
 * @returns The calculated total with breakdown
 * @throws {ValidationError} When items array is empty
 * @example
 * const total = calculateOrderTotal(items, 0.08, 'SAVE10');
 */
export function calculateOrderTotal(
  items: OrderItem[],
  taxRate: number,
  discountCode?: string
): OrderTotal { ... }
```

## API Documentation
- Use OpenAPI/Swagger for REST APIs
- Document all endpoints: method, path, params, body, responses
- Include example requests and responses
- Document error codes and their meanings
- Keep docs in sync with code (prefer auto-generation)

## Architecture Documentation
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for significant decisions
- System diagrams updated quarterly
- Data flow diagrams for complex processes
- Runbooks for operational procedures
- Incident post-mortems documented and shared

## README Template
Every repository MUST include:
1. Project description and purpose
2. Quick start / setup instructions
3. Development workflow
4. Testing instructions
5. Deployment process
6. Architecture overview
7. Contributing guidelines
